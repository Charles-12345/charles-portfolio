# üìà Power BI Dashboards

This folder contains professional dashboards developed for:
- Youth Empowerment Program tracking
- Gender-sensitive indicators visualization
- Conflict zone monitoring

Each dashboard is built using real program data (anonymized or simulated).

## Featured Dashboards

| Dashboard | Description | Format |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `Youth_Activity.pbix` | Tracks youth engagement and training indicators | `.pbix` |
| `Conflict_Heatmap.pbix` | Visual map of conflict-prone counties | `.pbix` |
| `Gender_Indicators.pbix` | Gender-disaggregated indicator overview | `.pbix` |

üìå **Note**: Some visuals may require the sample datasets found in `/datasets/sample-datasets`.
